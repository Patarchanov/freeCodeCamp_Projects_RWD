            Hello, I am Nikola. Probably as many of you I am just an amateur PC hardware (and software in some cases) fan. Everything started around a year before the COVID lockdown. I needed a new PC for work/gaming/chilling so decide that it will be fun to choose and build the PC completely alone. Just for your information, at that moment I had problems to make a difference between GPU and CPU cooler. Yeah I was complete noob if I can say so.

          <p>This will be a guide mainly based on my personal experience and PoV. As I said before I’m just PC enthusiast who can share some information and experience for the different PC parts and I hope I will help to at least one person with this guide. Through the COVID lockdown I built many (around 20) systems and helped multiple friends with specific hardware questions and problems. Something IMPORTANT, the info is based on Ryzen systems because between 2019-2021 they had better price/performance ratio. Feel free to contact me if some of the information is not right or harmful.</p>

        <header>What you should consider first</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The first and probably most important thing is to clearly understand for what exactly you are going to use the PC that you want to buy. For work you will need one type of system but for gaming most of the time completely different. Some people just build super powerful and expensive systems that can be used for various purposes. As I always say “with big budget everyone can build a decent/good PC”. So if your budget is not a problem, you can skip many of the guides and just ask in reddit “what you are going to recommend for gaming with budget X$?”. But if you are like me and your budget is something below average or even lower, information from the guides will be pretty useful. Also if your future system is somewhere between “budget” and “average” my advice is to always consider price/performance ratio. If you prefer performance than look you can save some money or just increase the performance.

          I will try to give basic/advanced information about the parts and I will include some interesting sources where you can find detailed explanations. I will mainly focus on brands that I have experience with. Brands and parts that are mostly focused on performance and not so shiny and fancy.

         Let’s say that the case is the home of your PC. Few factors are pretty important for me, size and fan positions (aka cooling potential). I will always recommend bigger case because you can build/change parts easier, you can fit biffy CPU coolers and big GPUs and I will always recommend case with “open” front panel and many places for fans. Consider good filters as something that can save you time when you clean your PC. Few cases that I like to work with:

              Fractal Design Meshify C

         <p>
          This is the part which will probably vary the most depending of the build purposes. My personal advice is to check the software that you are going to use and the requirements if the build is for work. If you are gamer, I think still 95% of the games will work more than fine with 6 cores so everything above will have a slight performance increase. Few CPUs that I can recommend for gaming and production:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ryzen 5 5600
            </li>
            <li>
              Ryzen 9 5900x

            There are few important things to consider here. What connections do you need (how many DPs, how many USBs and etc.), how many m.2 slots do you need and are you a overclock enthusiast? If you want to spend more time overclocking and having fun with your system I highly recommend to check

            link and spend some time to understand the data inside. If you are going for price/performance ratio and you want the sweet spot I would recommend B550 motherboard. Here are few options for you:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              GIGABYTE B550 AORUS ELITE AX V2
            </li>
            <li>
              MSI B550 TOMAHAWK

            Joke aside but if you are an enthusiast and want to overclock your RAM this is probably the most difficult part to choose. My personal suggestion is more ram > faster ram. I’ve used all of the ram chips that you can find in the shops and I can recommend some decent Hynix chip, dual rank and 32GB at that moment. For the overclockers and enthusiasts it’s easy, go

            and find what ever you need, but for people like me who likes price/performance this option is pretty good:

            For work as I said in the previous sentences just check your software requirement but for gaming go big. If you want decent frames on 1080p (which is the minimum right now I think) go 3060 ti and you will be fine. Everything above 3060 ti (and some can say that even 3060 ti is good 1440p card) is for 1440p and even 2160p. I can recommend one brand here:

          <p>My advice here is go for m.2 and check the speed/price ratio. The most systems that I build used and still using without problems one brand:</p>

          Probably many of you think “what is bronze, gold and platinum” and the simple answer is power efficiency and the quality of the parts.

        <article>
          <p>Call me a grandpa but I will always recommend good cooling for all of your parts. If you are casual user the PC will be quiet and work well while if you are gamer/overclocker the PC will perform at the maximum and will work nice. As I already mentioned first thing is good case with good airflow, fresh air coming from the front panel and hot air exhausted from the top-left corner. For the enthusiasts there are many and interesting options but for a casual price/performance used I would recommend 2x140mm/3x140mm fans on the front panel which will pull air inside of the case and 1x120/140mm exhaust at the left-top side and probably 1x120/140mm exhaust on the top-left side. This will work pretty good in 95% of the cases. For CPU cooling I will suggest biffy air cooler. They are literally best price/performance solution because the only thing that can be damaged in the years of use is a fan which will probably cost you less than 15$ and you are in the game again. I even pimped my GPU because the original fans were laud and ineffective –

              >
            .  I will recommend probably something that many will describe as “overkill” but I like good cooling:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>For case fans - Arctic P14</li>
            <li>For CPU cooler - Noctua NH-D15</li>

          <p>This category can be pretty long and I can speak about it a lot, but let’s stick to the most important one which the monitor. My personal suggestion is if you are not a gamer and work on the PC go for bigger size and higher resolution, 60Hz are enough for you. If you are a gamer choose your monitor depends on what GPU you have or you want to buy. Once you play on 144Hz with 140+ frames you will never come back to 60Hz, trust me.

          <p>This is a part from my coding project that’s why the information for the PC parts is so short. I could easily speak/write way more for the parts that I like the most but that’s not the purpose now. Still if you find it interesting and you have questions you can always poke me. Have fun building! 😊
